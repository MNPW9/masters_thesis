# masters_thesis

---Best practices---
Create C://code in computer

Git clone: https://github.com/MNPW9/masters_thesis.git
to the C://code folder and unpack. 

The jupyter notebook files (mean_variance_simulation.ipynb, efficient_frontiers.ipynb, backtest.ipynb, and requirements.txt) should be place in the C://code//masters_thesis
directory directly. 

If using virutal_env install the modules from gitbash terminal by running 
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file contains the modules that are require to run the files like the authors intended.
